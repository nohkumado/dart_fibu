# Contribute to FiBu

you are very welcome to contribute to this project! to allow better work flow,
please  follow the following suggestions:

- clone the whole repository and make one git branch per change you want to
  implement, so as to be able to review and integrate small changesets, and
not break the whole.

- please, and i know myself that it is hard, don't stint on the comments ;)
- also, don't forget to run all tests before commiting to the repo!
